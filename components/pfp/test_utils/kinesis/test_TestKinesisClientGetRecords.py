Scenario 1: Verify normal operation of _get_records
Details:
  TestName: test_get_records_normal_operation
  Description: Verify if _get_records works as expected with valid input data. The expectation is to have the function successfully retrieve and return all the records. This ensures that the basic functionality of the method is working.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the enclosing class. Get a valid first_shard_iterator.
  Act: Call _get_records passing a valid first_shard_iterator.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is a list and that all records have been retrieved.
Validation:
  This test verifies the standard behavior of the function, ensuring that it is able to successfully retrieve and return all records from the Kinesis Shard.

Scenario 2: Validate _get_records when there are no records
Details:
  TestName: test_get_records_no_records
  Description: The goal is to validate that the function _get_records returns an empty list when there are no records to get.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the enclosing class. Get an empty first_shard_iterator.
  Act: Call _get_records passing the empty first shard iterator.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is an empty list.
Validation:
  The test is important to ascertain that the function can handle the situation where there are no records to retrieve, by correctly returning an empty list.

Scenario 3: Validate _get_records when NextShardIterator is not returned in boto3_response
Details:
  TestName: test_get_records_boto_no_next_shard_iterator
  Description: Validate that the function _get_records correctly stops retrieving when there are no more ShardIterators.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the enclosing class. Get a valid first_shard_iterator. The boto3 client should be mocked to not return a NextShardIterator in a response.
  Act: Call _get_records. 
  Assert: Check if all the records until the final ShardIterator have been collected and returned.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function can correctly identify when there are no more records to retrieve, preventing unnecessary subsequent retrievals.

Scenario 4: Validate _get_records when boto3 response is not successful
Details:
  TestName: test_get_records_unsuccessful_boto3_response
  Description: This test checks how _get_records behaves when a boto3 response is not successful.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the enclosing class. Mock the boto3 client to return a non-successful HTTPStatusCode.
  Act: Call _get_records.
  Assert: Check that the function does not attempt to process any records and gracefully handles the error response.
Validation:
  The test helps highlight the functionâ€™s ability to react appropriately to non-successful responses from the boto3 client.
