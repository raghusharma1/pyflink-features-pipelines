Scenario 1: Validating the fetch_avro_schema method with string file path
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_with_string_path
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the fetch_avro_schema method properly reads and parses the Avro schema from a provided file path string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a .avro schema file and know its path.
  Act: Invoke fetch_avro_schema method with a string file path as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function successfully returns a parsed schema.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test validates the basic functionality of the fetch_avro_schema method when the input is a string representing a file path, as it's one of the supported arguments the function can handle.

Scenario 2: Validating the fetch_avro_schema method with Traversable instance
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_with_traversable_instance
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the fetch_avro_schema method correctly reads and parses the Avro schema from a Traversable instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a .avro schema file and have its Traversable instance.
  Act: Invoke fetch_avro_schema method with a Traversable instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Confirm the function successfully returns a parsed schema.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test validates that the method can "traverse" through the file system, open a file, and parse the contents correctly when a Traversable instance is provided, as it's one of the valid arguments the function recognizes.

Scenario 3: Testing non-string and non-Traversable inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_invalid_args
  Description: This test is designed to ensure the fetch_avro_schema method raises an exception when provided with an invalid argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an argument that isn't a string or a Traversable instance.
  Act: Invoke fetch_avro_schema method with an invalid argument.
  Assert: Confirm that an exception is raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test is necessary because the method expects either a string or a Traversable instance as the argument. Any other type should raise an exception, guaranteeing expected input types and function integrity.

Scenario 4: Testing with a non-existent or invalid file path
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_with_invalid_file_path
  Description: This test ensures that the fetch_avro_schema method raises an exception if it attempts to fetch a schema from a non-existent or invalid file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a non-existent or invalid file path.
  Act: Invoke fetch_avro_schema method with the invalid file path.
  Assert: Confirm that an exception is raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test guarantees the method's robustness when dealing with missing or invalid files. It would ensure the error is caught and handled in a manner in tune with the business requirements of the function.
