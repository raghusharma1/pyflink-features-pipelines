Scenario 1: Valid local Avro schema address
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_with_valid_local_address
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function fetch_avro_schema correctly reads an Avro schema from a local file system and returns it in dictionary format when provided a valid local address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a LocalSchemaRegistryClient object. Prepare a valid Avro schema in local file system and get its path.
  Act: Invoke the fetch_avro_schema function on the client object, passing the local address of the prepared Avro schema as parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a valid dictionary representing the Avro schema.
Validation:
  Rationale: The function's main functionality is to extract Avro schema from either a local or remote location. Hence testing this core functionality ensures that the function does what it promises to do.

Scenario 2: Nonexistent local Avro schema address
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_with_nonexistent_local_address
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the fetch_avro_schema function raises an appropriate error when provided an address to a nonexistent local Avro schema.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a LocalSchemaRegistryClient object.
  Act: Invoke the fetch_avro_schema function, passing an address to a nonexistent local Avro schema as parameter.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate error is raised.
Validation:
  Rationale: Detecting non-existent Avro schema and raising appropriate error is also part of the function's responsibility. This test ensures that the function behaves as expected in this scenario.

Scenario 3: Valid remote Avro schema address
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_with_valid_remote_address
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function fetch_avro_schema correctly reads an Avro schema from a remote schema registry and returns it in dictionary format when provided a valid remote address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a RemoteSchemaRegistryClient object. Prepare a valid Avro schema in remote schema registry and get its address (name or ARN).
  Act: Invoke fetch_avro_schema function on the client object, passing the remote address of the prepared Avro schema as parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a valid dictionary representing the Avro schema from the remote registry.
Validation:
  Rationale: The function is also expected to fetch Avro schema from remote locations. Hence testing for this ensures that the function behaves correctly when given a remote address.

Scenario 4: Invalid Avro schema
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_with_invalid_avro_schema
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the fetch_avro_schema function raises an appropriate error when provided an address to an invalid Avro schema (either local or remote address).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a LocalSchemaRegistryClient or RemoteSchemaRegistryClient object.
  Act: Invoke fetch_avro_schema function, passing address to an invalid Avro schema.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate error is raised.
Validation:
  Rationale: The function is also responsible for validating Avro schema. Hence testing for this scenarios ensures that function behaves correctly when given an invalid Avro schema.
