ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fetch_avro_schema_85e241578b


Scenario 1: Test fetch_avro_schema with a valid address that contains AVRO schema
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_valid_address
  Description: Verify that fetch_avro_schema is able to correctly fetch and translate valid AVRO schemas.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a LocalSchemaRegistryClient and a valid AVRO schema address in .avsc format.
  Act: Invoke the method fetch_avro_schema using the valid address.
  Assert: Validate that a dictionary representing the AVRO schema is returned.
Validation:
  This test is important because it confirms that the function works under normal, correct-use conditions with valid input address.

Scenario 2: Test fetch_avro_schema with a valid address but the content does not contain AVRO schema
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_invalid_schema
  Description: Verify that fetch_avro_schema responds appropriately when the given address does not contain a valid AVRO schema.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a LocalSchemaRegistryClient and an address that does not lead to a valid AVRO schema.
  Act: Invoke the method fetch_avro_schema using the invalid address.
  Assert: An appropriate exception, possibly a ParseError, should be raised.
Validation:
  This case tests the function's ability to handle and report erroneous input.

Scenario 3: Test fetch_avro_schema with an address that does not exist or is inaccessible
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_inaccessible_address
  Description: Verify that fetch_avro_schema reacts as expected when the given address does not exist or cannot be reached.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a LocalSchemaRegistryClient and an address that does not exist or that the program will not have permission to access.
  Act: Call the fetch_avro_schema method using the inaccessible address.
  Assert: An appropriate exception, like FileNotFoundError or PermissionError, should be raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is resilient to failures in reaching the provided address, and that such failures are clearly reported.

Scenario 4: Test fetch_avro_schema with an Empty Address
Details:
  TestName: test_fetch_avro_schema_empty_address
  Description: Validate that fetch_avro_schema behaves correctly when called without any address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a LocalSchemaRegistryClient and an empty string as address.
  Act: Invoke the method fetch_avro_schema using the empty address.
  Assert: Validate that an appropriate exception, likely ValueError, is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function defends against being invoked without any address, an edge case that should be prevented.
