Scenario 1: Testing addition of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_merge_positive_integers
  Description: This test is designed to verify the correct summing up operation when both 'acc_a' and 'acc_b' are positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'acc_a' and 'acc_b' as two positive integer numbers.
  Act: Invoke the function merge with 'acc_a' and 'acc_b'.
  Assert: The function should return the sum of 'acc_a' and 'acc_b'.
Validation:
  The function relies on Python's built-in addition operation and is thus expected to correctly handle positive integers. This scenario verifies this basic aspect of the merge function.

Scenario 2: Testing addition of two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_merge_negative_integers
  Description: This test is designed to verify the correct summing up operation when both 'acc_a' and 'acc_b' are negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'acc_a' and 'acc_b' as two negative integer numbers.
  Act: Invoke the function merge with 'acc_a' and 'acc_b'.
  Assert: The function should return the sum of 'acc_a' and 'acc_b'.
Validation:
  The function needs to handle negative integers as well, this test will validate that two negative integers can be correctly added together.

Scenario 3: Testing addition of a positive and negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_merge_positive_and_negative
  Description: This test is designed to verify the correct summing up operation when 'acc_a' is a positive and 'acc_b' is a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'acc_a' as a positive integer number, and 'acc_b' as a negative integer number.
  Act: Invoke the function merge with 'acc_a' and 'acc_b'.
  Assert: The function should return the sum of 'acc_a' and 'acc_b'.
Validation:
  Accurate integer addition, including mixed positive and negative numbers, is a fundamental requirement for this function. This test verifies that requirement.

Scenario 4: Testing addition of zero and an integer
Details:
  TestName: test_merge_zero_and_integer
  Description: This test is designed to verify the correct sum of 'acc_a' and 'acc_b' when one of them is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'acc_a' as 0 and 'acc_b' as an integer.
  Act: Invoke the function merge with 'acc_a' and 'acc_b'.
  Assert: The function should return 'acc_b'.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to verify the function recognizes the additive identity property of zero.
