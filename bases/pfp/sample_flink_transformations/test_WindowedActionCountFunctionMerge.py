Scenario 1: Validate the merge operation with positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_merge_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies the merge operation's correctness when both acc_a and acc_b are positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the inputs are directly passed as parameters.
  Act: Invoke the merge function with two positive integer values.
  Assert: The output should be the sum of the two input values.
Validation:
  It is crucial to ensure that the merge function correctly adds two positive integers as it forms the basis of the function's operation.

Scenario 2: Validate the merge operation with zero
Details:
  TestName: test_merge_with_zero
  Description: This test is intended to validate the merge operation when either acc_a or acc_b is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the inputs are directly passed as parameters.
  Act: Call the merge function with one of the parameters being zero.
  Assert: The output should be the non-zero input.
Validation:
  It tests the function's behavior when one of the inputs is zero. The expected result is the value of the non-zero parameter.

Scenario 3: Validate the merge operation with negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_merge_negative_integers
  Description: The test is intended to verify the correctness of the merge operation when both acc_a and acc_b are negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No prep-up is required as the inputs are directly passed as parameters.
  Act: Invoke the merge function with two negative integer values.
  Assert: The output should be the sum of the two input negative values, resulting in a negative value.
Validation:
  It tests how the function handles negative values and ensures the correctness of the function under such scenarios.

Scenario 4: Validate the merge operation with large integers
Details:
  TestName: test_merge_large_integers
  Description: This test is intended to validate the merge operation when acc_a or acc_b is a large integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is needed as the inputs are directly passed as parameters.
  Act: Invoke the merge function with at least one large integer input.
  Assert: The output should be the arithmetic sum of the two inputs, even if the size of the result is large.
Validation:
  It ensures that the function handles large integer values correctly.

Scenario 5: Validate the merge operation with one positive and one negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_merge_positive_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to check the merge operation when acc_a is a positive integer, and acc_b is a negative integer or vice versa.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is needed as the inputs are directly passed as parameters.
  Act: Invoke the merge function with one positive and one negative integer.
  Assert: The output should be the arithmetic sum of the two input values, which can be positive, negative or zero.
Validation:
  It is important to ensure the function operates correctly when one of the parameters is positive, and the other is negative.
