```
Scenario 1: Valid UserActionIn Obj With Action Time
Details:
  TestName: test_extract_timestamp_valid
  Description: This test checks whether the function 'extract_timestamp' returns the expected timestamp (milliseconds from epoch) when provided with a valid UserActionIn object having action_time as a datetime object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid UserActionIn object with action_time attribute as a datetime object.
  Act: Invoke extract_timestamp function passing UserActionIn object.
  Assert: Check that the returned timestamp is as expected (milliseconds from epoch).
Validation:
  This ensures that the function is accurately converting the action_time in datetime object to milliseconds from epoch which is crucial for subsequent data processing mechanisms.

Scenario 2: UserActionIn Obj With Future Action Time
Details:
  TestName: test_extract_timestamp_future_time
  Description: This test validates the ability of the function 'extract_timestamp' to handle future times correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid UserActionIn object with action_time attribute as a datetime object in the future.
  Act: Invoke extract_timestamp function passing UserActionIn object.
  Assert: Check that the returned timestamp is as expected and also is greater than the current timestamp.
Validation:
  By confirming the program can handle future timestamps appropriately, this secures the software's effectiveness during real-time processing where future timestamps might occur.

Scenario 3: UserActionIn Obj With Past Action Time
Details:
  TestName: test_extract_timestamp_past_time
  Description: This test checks the function 'extract_timestamp' to see if it can correctly handle timestamps from the past.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid UserActionIn object with action_time attribute as a datetime object in the past.
  Act: Invoke extract_timestamp function passing UserActionIn object.
  Assert: Check that the returned timestamp is as expected and also is less than the current timestamp.
Validation:
  Testing the program's ability to flag and handle past timestamps correctly ensures the robustness of the function, which is essential for accurate timing mechanisms and downstream features.

Scenario 4: UserActionIn Obj with Action Time as None
Details:
  TestName: test_extract_timestamp_no_action_time
  Description: This test checks the ability of the function 'extract_timestamp' to handle UserActionIn objects where the action_time is None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid UserActionIn object with action_time attribute as None.
  Act: Invoke extract_timestamp function passing UserActionIn object.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate exception is raised or the function should return None.
Validation:
  This ensures that the function can handle instances where action_time is not provided, thus maintaining the stability of the application as a whole.
