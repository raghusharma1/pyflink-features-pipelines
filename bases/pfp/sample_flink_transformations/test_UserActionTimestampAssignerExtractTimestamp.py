Scenario 1: Extracting timestamp from a UserActionIn with valid action time.
Details:
  TestName: test_extract_timestamp_with_valid_action_time
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful extraction of timestamp from a UserActionIn object with a valid action_time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a UserActionIn object with a known action_time and create an instance of the class containing the extract_timestamp method.
  Act: Invoke the extract_timestamp method with the created UserActionIn object.
  Assert: The returned value should be the milliseconds since epoch corresponding to the action_time initialized.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test scenario checks the main functionality of the extract_timestamp method. A correct implementation will ensure that the timestamp is accurately extracted.

Scenario 2: Extracting timestamp from a UserActionIn with maximum timestamp limit.
Details:
  TestName: test_extract_timestamp_with_max_limit
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when extracting timestamp from a UserActionIn with the maximum allowable action_time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a UserActionIn object with the maximum allowable action_time and create an instance of the class containing the extract_timestamp method.
  Act: Invoke the extract_timestamp method with the created UserActionIn object.
  Assert: The returned value should be the equivalent milliseconds since epoch of the maximum allowable action_time.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test scenario checks the extract_timestamp method's performance when handling the maximum limit of action_time. Testing this will ensure that the function can handle boundary conditions.

Scenario 3: Extracting timestamp from a UserActionIn with minimum timestamp limit.
Details:
  TestName: test_extract_timestamp_with_min_limit
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when extracting timestamp from a UserActionIn with the minimum allowable action_time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a UserActionIn object with the minimum allowable action_time, and create an instance of the class containing the extract_timestamp method.
  Act: Invoke the extract_timestamp method with the created UserActionIn object.
  Assert: The returned value should be the equivalent milliseconds since epoch of the minimum allowable action_time.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test scenario checks the extract_timestamp method's performance when handling the minimum limit of action_time. Testing this will ensure that the function can handle boundary conditions.

Scenario 4: Extracting timestamp from a UserActionIn with NULL action time.
Details:
  TestName: test_extract_timestamp_with_null_action_time
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when extracting timestamp from a UserActionIn with NULL as action_time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a UserActionIn object with NULL action_time, and create an instance of the class containing the extract_timestamp method.
  Act: Invoke the extract_timestamp method with the created UserActionIn object.
  Assert: The returned value should be handled appropriately based on the business logic or throw an appropriate error.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test scenario checks the functionality of the extract_timestamp method when supplied with NULL values, testing its resilience and error-handling abilities.
