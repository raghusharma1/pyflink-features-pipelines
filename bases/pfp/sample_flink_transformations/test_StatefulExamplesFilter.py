```
Scenario 1: Test Action Type Match
Details:
  TestName: test_action_type_match
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns True when the action type of the input matches with the specified action type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of UserActionIn such that user_action.action_type.value is equal to the specified action type.
  Act: Call the _filter function with the created instance of UserActionIn.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test verifies the basic functionality of the _filter function. If the function passes this test, it implies that it can correctly identify when action types match.

Scenario 2: Test Action Type Mismatch
Details:
  TestName: test_action_type_mismatch
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns False when the action type of the input does not match with the specified action type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of UserActionIn such that user_action.action_type.value is not equal to the specified action type.
  Act: Call the _filter function with the created instance of UserActionIn.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns False.
Validation:
  If the function passes this test, it implies that it can correctly identify when action types don't match. This test is essential to prevent the function from processing irrelevant user actions.

Scenario 3: Test Action Type Case Sensitivity
Details:
  TestName: test_action_type_case_sensitivity
  Description: Test to verify that the function treats action types in a case-sensitive manner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of UserActionIn such that user_action.action_type.value has different casing than the specified action type.
  Act: Call the _filter function with the created instance of UserActionIn.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves as expected in identifying action types, handling them in a case-sensitive manner, and thereby maintaining consistency in the way actions are classified.

Scenario 4: Test with Null Action Type 
Details:
  TestName: test_null_action_type
  Description: Test to verify how the function handles when input action type is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of UserActionIn with a null action type.
  Act: Call the _filter method with the created instance of UserActionIn.
  Assert: Verify that the function handles this scenario gracefully, likely by returning False.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function is robust and can handle null input gracefully - an important aspect for its overall reliability.
