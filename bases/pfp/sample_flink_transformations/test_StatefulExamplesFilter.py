```
Scenario 1: Test for matching action types
Details:
  TestName: test_action_type_match
  Description: This test is intended to validate the situation where the `user_action.action_type.value` equals `action_type.value`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a UserActionIn instance with action_type set to a specific ActionType.
  Act: Call the _filter function with the prepared UserActionIn instance.
  Assert: Check if the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test will confirm that our function correctly identifies matching action types, a critical functionality as per the business requirement.

Scenario 2: Test for non-matching action types
Details:
  TestName: test_action_type_mismatch
  Description: This test intends to verify the situation where the `user_action.action_type.value` does not equal `action_type.value`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a UserActionIn instance with action_type set to a specific ActionType that's different from the one in filter function.
  Act: Call the _filter function with the prepared UserActionIn instance.
  Assert: Check if the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test will validate that the function correctly identifies non-matching action types, which is crucial for ensuring accurate filtering.

Scenario 3: Test with None action type in UserActionIn
Details:
  TestName: test_action_type_none_in_input
  Description: This test is intended to validate the scenario where the action type of the UserActionIn object is None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a UserActionIn instance with action_type set to None.
  Act: Call the _filter function with the prepared UserActionIn instance.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns False since a None action type can't be equal to any specific action type.
Validation:
  This test will make sure that the function can correctly handle None action types in the input, hence preventing potential Null/NoneType errors.

Scenario 4: Test with empty action type in UserActionIn
Details:
  TestName: test_action_type_empty_in_input
  Description: This test is intended to test the scenario where the action type of the UserActionIn object is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange:  Prepare a UserActionIn instance with action_type set to an empty value.
  Act: Call the _filter function with the prepared UserActionIn instance.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False, considering that an empty input value should not be equal to any specific action type.
Validation:
  The purpose of this test is to ensure that the function handles empty action types in the input correctly by providing appropriate results.
