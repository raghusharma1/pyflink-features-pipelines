```python
Scenario 1: Count all user action without action_type filter
Details:
  TestName: test_count_all_user_actions_no_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify if all actions for each user were correctly counted when no action_type is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a DataStream object (actions_stream) filled with instances of UserActionIn (at least two instances per user, with distinct timestamps), and no ActionType filter.
  Act: Invoke the count_user_all_actions function with the instantiated DataStream and no ActionType.
  Assert: Assert if the output DataStream emits a number of actions that matches the input data for each user.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly aggregates the count for each user without applying a filter condition. This is a key functionality of the system as it allows observing the total activity of each user.

Scenario 2: Count user action with action_type filter
Details:
  TestName: test_count_all_user_actions_with_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function filters and then correctly counts actions for each user when an action_type is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a DataStream object (actions_stream) filled with instances of UserActionIn (at least two instances per user, with distinct timestamps, and different action types), and an ActionType filter.
  Act: Invoke the count_all_user_actions function with the instantiated DataStream and ActionType.
  Assert: Assert if the output DataStream emits a number of filtered actions that matches the input data for each user.
Validation:
  The test ensures if the function can filter by action_type and then accurately count user actions. It is crucial as it allows observing activity of users based on action type.

Scenario 3: Count user action on an empty stream
Details:
  TestName: test_count_all_user_actions_empty_stream
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the function performs as expected when the incoming DataStream is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Get an empty DataStream object, and no ActionType filter.
  Act: Invoke the count_all_user_actions function with the empty DataStream and no ActionType.
  Assert: Assert if the output DataStream is also empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle edge cases, such as when there is no existing action. It is essential to ensure the robustness of the business logic.
