```
Scenario 1: Verify user action count without action type filter
Details:
  TestName: test_count_all_user_actions_without_filter
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the method returns correct counts of actions for each user when no action_type parameter is supplied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a DataStream with known user actions data. Create an instance of the ActionsCountFunction class.
  Act: Call the count_all_user_actions function with the pre-prepared DataStream and without any action type.
  Assert: Check that the resulting DataStream has correct action counts for each user.
Validation:
  This test verifies that count_all_user_actions can correctly count user actions when no action_type parameter is supplied. This is a basic functionality of the function and should be tested to ensure that it works as expected.

Scenario 2: Verify user action count with action type filter
Details:
  TestName: test_count_all_user_actions_with_filter
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method returns correct counts of actions of a specific type for each user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a DataStream with known user actions data, including different types of actions. Create an instance of the ActionsCountFunction class.
  Act: Call the count_all_user_actions function with the pre-prepared DataStream and an action type parameter.
  Assert: Check that the resulting DataStream has correct action counts of that specific type for each user.
Validation:
  This test verifies that count_all_user_actions can correctly count user actions of a specific type. This is a more advanced functionality of the function and its correct working is essential for business requirements that need to analyze user actions based on their types.
  
Scenario 3: Verify user action count with an empty actions stream
Details:
  TestName: test_count_all_user_actions_empty_stream
  Description: This test is intended to verify the behavior of the method when it receives an empty actions stream.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty DataStream object. Create an instance of the ActionsCountFunction class.
  Act: Call the count_all_user_actions function with the empty DataStream.
  Assert: Check that the resulting DataStream is also empty.
Validation:
  It's important to test this scenario to ensure that the function can handle this edge case. In this case, the function should respond by returning an empty DataStream without raising any exceptions.
