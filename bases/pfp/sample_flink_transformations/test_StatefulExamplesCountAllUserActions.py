```
Scenario 1: Test when all user actions are of the same type
Details:
  TestName: test_AllUserActionsOfSameType
  Description: The test intends to verify the behavior of the function when all user actions are of a specified type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a series of user actions of the same type
  Act: Pass the stream into the function with the action type specified
  Assert: Expect the function output to be a count of all the actions for each user as all actions are of the specified type.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it validates the function's core competence of counting user actions of a specified type, in this case when all actions are of the same type.

Scenario 2: Test when no user action is of a specified type
Details:
  TestName: test_NoUserActionsOfSpecifiedType
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves when none of the user actions matches the specified type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a series of user actions of various different types.
  Act: Pass the stream into the function with an action type that is not in the prepared stream.
  Assert: Expect the function output to be zero as none of the actions should match the specified type.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies the function's ability to correctly filter and count user actions according to the specified type, particularly when none of the user actions matches the specified type.

Scenario 3: Test when action type is None
Details:
  TestName: test_ActionTypeIsNone
  Description: This test is meant to verify how the function behaves when no action type is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a series of user actions of various types.
  Act: Pass the stream into the function with no action type specified.
  Assert: Expect the function output to be a count of all actions of various types for each user as no action type has been specified.
Validation:
  This test checks how the function handles situations when no action type is specified, and whether it can correctly count all actions regardless of their types.

Scenario 4: Test when actions stream is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_emptyActionsStream
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves when there are no user actions to count.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty stream.
  Act: Pass the empty steam into the function.
  Assert: Expect function output to be zero as there are no user actions to count.
Validation:
  This test verifies if the function correctly handles cases where there are no user actions to count, an edge case that must be efficiently managed.
