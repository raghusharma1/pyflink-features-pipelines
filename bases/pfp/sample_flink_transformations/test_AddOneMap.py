Scenario 1: Testing normal integer input
Details:
  TestName: test_map_addition
  Description: Testing the map function with a normal integer input. The function is supposed to return the input value incremented by one.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required for this scenario.
  Act: Call the map function on an integer input like 5.
  Assert: Expect the output to be one more than the input value, in this case 6.
Validation:
  This test checks the basic increment function of the map method. The expected result verifies the core logic of incrementing a given number by one.

Scenario 2: Testing with zero as input
Details:
  TestName: test_map_zero_input
  Description: Testing the map function with zero as input. It should return 1 as per the function logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required for this scenario.
  Act: Call the map function on an integer input of 0.
  Assert: Expect the output to be 1 as per the function logic.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that the logic works when the input value is zero. 

Scenario 3: Testing with negative integer input
Details:
  TestName: test_map_negative_input
  Description: Testing map function with negative integer input. It should return the input value incremented by one.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required for this scenario.
  Act: Call the map function on a negative integer such as -5.
  Assert: The output is expected to be -4, as the function adds 1 to the input integer.
Validation:
  This test validates whether the map function could handle negative integers and behave as expected.

Scenario 4: Testing with large integer values
Details:
  TestName: test_map_large_values
  Description: Testing the map function with very large integer values to check whether the function maintains its expected behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required for this scenario.
  Act: Invoke the map function on a very large integer like 10000000000.
  Assert: The output should be 10000000001, one more than the input value.
Validation:
  This test is crucial in checking whether the map function maintains its behavior even under extreme conditions with large inputs.

Note: These scenarios assume that the function will only be provided with integer values, in line with the function map signature taking an integer and returning an integer.
