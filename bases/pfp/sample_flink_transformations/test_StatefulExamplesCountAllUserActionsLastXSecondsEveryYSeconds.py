```
Scenario 1: Actions count for multiple windows 
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_windows_actions_count
  Description: This test is intended to check the logic of the function when dealing with multiple windows of data over time. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a DataStream object with appropriate values. Also, set values for window_size_seconds and window_slide_seconds such that multiple windows are created.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared DataStream object and window parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned DataStream object contains the correct count of actions for each corresponding window.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the main functionality of the function, which is counting actions over multiple windows. It has a significant impact if the system were to be deployed in an environment with extensive user actions. 

Scenario 2: Single action in a window
Details:
  TestName: test_single_action_window
  Description: A test to validate the function's response to a DataStream object with a single action.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a DataStream object with a single action. Set the window size and slide values accordingly.
  Act: Call the function using the DataStream object and window parameters.
  Assert: The function should return a DataStream object. The count of actions in the window should be 1.
Validation:
  Checking if the function can handle situations with less data is vital to ensure it functions correctly even under low volume data sessions.
  
Scenario 3: Overlapping window actions count
Details:
  TestName: test_overlapping_window_actions_count
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can correctly count the number of actions that span multiple overlapping windows.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize DataStream with various actions that would span over multiple overlapping windows.
  Act: Invoke the function with the DataStream object and window parameters that would result in the creation of overlapping windows.
  Assert: Check that the count of actions per overlapping window is correct.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the ability of the function to correctly count actions that span multiple overlapping windows. This scenario is common in real-world applications where user actions can span over multiple time windows.
  

Scenario 4: Test null or empty DataStream 
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_datastream
  Description: This test will check how the function behaves when the DataStream input is null or empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a null or empty DataStream.
  Act: Call the function with the null or empty DataStream and any arbitrary window parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the function appropriately handles the null or empty DataStream without resulting in any errors.
Validation:
  It is necessary to test how a function handles null or empty inputs, as they are common edge cases in real-world scenarios.
