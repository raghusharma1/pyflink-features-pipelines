Scenario 1: Correct calculation of user actions in a single window
Details:
  TestName: test_single_window_user_action_calculation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly calculates the count of actions per user over a single time window.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a DataStream with a defined set of user actions, each associated with specific timestamps within an assigned window.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared DataStream, an appropriately sized window and sliding intervals.
  Assert: Check that the returned DataStream includes correct counts of actions per user within the defined window.
Validation:
  The test is crucial for validating that the function processes the streaming data correctly over a single window, which is a fundamental requirement for user action count.

Scenario 2: Proper functioning of sliding windows
Details:
  TestName: test_sliding_window_function
  Description: This test checks whether the function accurately processes sliding windows, i.e., produces correct user action counts regardless of window overlaps.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a DataStream with user actions spread across timestamps which create overlapping windows.
  Act: Call the function with the prepared DataStream and small enough window sliding intervals to create multiple overlapping windows.
  Assert: Verify that each window calculates user action counts correctly, considering overlaps.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure that the function correctly handles the complexity introduced by overlapping windows (due to window sliding), reflecting realistic timeline analysis.

Scenario 3: proper handling of unordered user actions
Details:
  TestName: test_unordered_user_actions_handling
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function handles user actions that are not in chronological order, considering the watermark strategy.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a DataStream where user actions have timestamps that are not strictly increasing.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared DataStream, suitable window size, and sliding intervals.
  Assert: Check that the function correctly identifies and orders user actions according to the timestamps.
Validation:
  This test is important to validate the function's robustness in delivering reliable results in 'real-world' scenarios, where data might not always appear in chronological order.

Scenario 4: Effective timestamp assignment
Details:
  TestName: test_effective_timestamp_assignment
  Description: This test is designed to confirm whether the function properly assigns timestamps to user actions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a DataStream with a known set of user actions, each having specific timestamps.
  Act: Call the function with the prepared DataStream, adequate window size, and sliding intervals.
  Assert: Verify that the timestamps assigned to user actions reflect the correct original values.
Validation:
  The accuracy of timestamp assignment is crucial for the correct functioning of the windowing and watermarking strategy and validating user actions within sliding windows. 

Scenario 5: Quality Preservation for High Volume Data Streams
Details:
  TestName: test_high_volume_user_actions
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function can handle high volumes of user actions without sacrificing the accuracy of counts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a high volume DataStream of user actions.
  Act: Invoke the function with the high-volume DataStream, reasonable window size, and sliding intervals.
  Assert: Check if the function accurately counts the actions of each user over the defined windows without affecting the processing speed.
Validation:
  This performance test scenario is important to measure the function's scalability in handling realistic, high-volume user interactions. The function needs to efficiently process large volumes of data while preserving its quality.
