Scenario 1: Basic Addition Increment Functionality
Details:
  TestName: test_add_function_basic_increment
  Description: This test validates the basic functionality of the add() function which is to increment the accumulator by one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialise the accumulator to a known integer, e.g. 0 or 5. Initialise a UserActionIn object.
  Act: Call the add() function, passing the UserActionIn instance and the accumulator.
  Assert: Check that the output is the original accumulator incremented by 1.
Validation:
  The add function is expected to always increment the accumulator by 1 regardless of the UserActionIn object. This test validates this basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Return Type Validation
Details:
  TestName: test_add_function_return_type
  Description: This test verifies that the return type of the add() function is always an integer, regardless of the inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initial several accumulators and UserActionIn objects, for example, accumulators that are positive, negative, and zero.
  Act: Call the add() function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the type of the return value is an integer in all cases.
Validation:
  As a function designed to increment an accumulator, the add method will always result in an integer value, important in verifying the integrity of the function's output.

Scenario 3: Large Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_add_function_large_inputs
  Description: This test validates that the add() function can handle an extremely large accumulator.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialise large accumulators, such as 10**18, and a UserActionIn object.
  Act: Call the add() function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the output is the original accumulator value incremented by 1.
Validation:
  This checks the function's performance and stability under extreme circumstances, ensuring that the function can handle any integer value.

Scenario 4: Negative Input Values
Details:
  TestName: test_add_function_negative_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function works correctly when the accumulator is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialise a negative accumulator and a UserActionIn object.
  Act: Invoke the add() function.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the initial accumulator incremented by 1.
Validation:
  The function should be able to handle negative numbers just as it handles positive numbers, this test ensures that such aspect is covered.
