Scenario 1: Validate state retrieval from RuntimeContext
Details:
  TestName: test_open_state_retrieval
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the method `open` accurately retrieves the state from RuntimeContext.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new RuntimeContext with a given state, where the state is associated with a ValueStateDescriptor with the name "actions_counter" and an int type.
  Act: Invoke the open method, passing the created RuntimeContext as the argument.
  Assert: Check that the retrieved state using the method is the exact state initially passed through the RuntimeContext.
Validation:
  Rationale: It's vital to ensure that the state is correctly retrieved from the RuntimeContext because the state might control the flow or logic of the process. This is directly related to the business requirement that stipulates accuracy and rightness in processing the data.

Scenario 2: Confirm Null state initialization
Details:
  TestName: test_open_null_initialization
  Description: The purpose of this test is to confirm that the method `open` handles a null state properly by assigning an appropriate initial value, in this case, None since `actions_count` is set to None initially.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new RuntimeContext without passing in any state.
  Act: Call the open method, providing the created RuntimeContext.
  Assert: Make sure that the actions_count remains None after the open method is invoked.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test guarantees that the open function can gracefully handle scenarios where no state is present in the RuntimeContext. Consequently, the function's robustness and reliability increase, fulfilling the business mandate for robust data processing.

Scenario 3: Validate the type information used in the ValueStateDescriptor
Details:
  TestName: test_open_value_type_info
  Description: This test is intended to confirm that the type information used when creating the ValueStateDescriptor in the method `open` is of int type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new RuntimeContext with a state of int type.
  Act: Invoke the open method with the created RuntimeContext.
  Assert: Check that the ValueStateDescriptor used inside the method is created with the value type of int.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test scenario is crucial because it verifies that the function uses the correct type for the ValueStateDescriptor, which can avoid potential type corruption problems in state management and ensure flawless business logic execution.
