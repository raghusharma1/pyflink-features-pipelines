Scenario 1: Valid ValueStateDescriptor initiation and State Assignment
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_state_assignment
  Description: This test will verify if the ValueStateDescriptor is effectively instantiated and the actions_count attribute correctly assigned the runtime_context state value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a RuntimeContext with an assigned state.
  Act: Call the open function with the prepared RuntimeContext as a parameter.
  Assert: The actions_count attribute of the object should match the state of RuntimeContext.
Validation:
  As this method's purpose is to initialize the "actions_count" state correctly based on runtime context, validating its success is critical in ensuring the flow and continuity of data-based operations in subsequent methods.

Scenario 2: Exploration of Default Behaviour
Details:
  TestName: test_default_behaviour
  Description: This test will explore how the function behaves if the runtime_context state hasn't been previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: A RuntimeContext instance is created without assigning any state.
  Act: The open method is called with the unassigned RuntimeContext instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly handles the situation without breaking or throwing unexpected errors, possibly by using the default value of the ValueStateDescriptor.
Validation:
  In real-life applications, it's possible to encounter scenarios in which the runtime_context's state hasn't been set yet. Thus, this test ensures the function maintains robustness and handles such conditions gracefully.

Scenario 3: Testing the ValueStateDescriptor Name Value
Details:
  TestName: test_value_state_descriptor_name
  Description: Verifies that the ValueStateDescriptor gets assigned the proper name "actions_counter."
Execution:
  Arrange: The open method is taken under consideration with a runtime_context as input.
  Act: Call the open method using a runtime_context instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Upon accessing the name attribute of the ValueStateDescriptor, the name "actions_counter" is returned.
Validation:
  It is crucial to verify the name assignment of ValueStateDescriptor as it may be used for identification and extraction purposes in later methods, conforming to the business logic execution.
