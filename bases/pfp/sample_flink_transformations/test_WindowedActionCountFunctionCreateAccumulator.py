Scenario 1: Testing the Accumulator Initialization
Details:
  TestName: test_accumulator_initialization
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the accumulator is properly initialized by using the create_accumulator method, focusing on its default value (0).
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class containing the create_accumulator method.
  Act: Invoke the create_accumulator method.
  Assert: Check if the returned accumulator's value equals 0.
Validation:
  Rationale: It is vital to begin the computations with an accumulator that has a consistent and predictable initial value. The business logic assumes the accumulator's initial value to be 0. An incorrect initialization can result in flawed computations.

Scenario 2: Test Accumulator's Return Type
Details:  
  TestName: test_accumulator_return_type
  Description: This test is intended to confirm that the method create_accumulator returns an integer type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class containing the create_accumulator method.
  Act: Invoke the create_accumulator method and check the returned value's type.
  Assert: Validate that the returned value is indeed of integer type.
Validation:
  Rationale: Accumulators are traditionally integers, being integral to many computations. Ensuring the return data-type of create_accumulator is integer is essential to safeguard against the compatibility issues. 

Scenario 3: Test Accumulator's Immutability
Details:  
  TestName: test_accumulator_immutability
  Description: This test aims to verify that the initial value of the accumulator remains constant and is not susceptible to change once it has been created.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and create an accumulator.
  Act: Attempt to change the accumulator's value.
  Assert: Validate that the accumulator's value remains unchanged and equals 0.
Validation:
  Rationale: An accumulator's purpose is aggregating computations, thus its value must remain consistent. If accumulatorâ€™s initial value changes, it will alter computation results and violate business logic correctness.
