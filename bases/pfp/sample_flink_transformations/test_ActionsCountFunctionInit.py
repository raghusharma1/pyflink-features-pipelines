```
Scenario 1: Validate initialization of actions_count
Details:
  TestName: test_init_actions_count
  Description: This test will verify if the actions_count attribute is set to None during initialization properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class without passing any parameter.
  Act: Deserialize the instance to check its attributes.
  Assert: The attribute, actions_count, should be None.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that attributes are set correctly during initialization. It would ensure that attribute assignments in the __init__ method function correctly.

Scenario 2: Validate attribute modification post initialization
Details:
  TestName: test_attribute_modification
  Description: This test will ensure attributes can be changed after instantiation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the actions_count to some value (let's say 10) post creation.
  Act: Deserialize the instance to check its attributes.
  Assert: The action_count should reflect the new value set (in this case, it should be 10).
Validation:
  This test verifies the flexibility of class instances to have their attributes modified after instantiation, which is an important part of Python classes.

Scenario 3: Validate the class instance to carry None in actions_count after clearing it
Details:
  TestName: test_attribute_clear
  Description: This test will check if an attribute can be cleared and set back to None after modification.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set actions_count to some value (let's say 10). Later, clear the actions_count attribute by setting it back to None.
  Act: Deserialize the instance to check its attributes.
  Assert: The actions_count attribute should be None.
Validation:
  This test is needed to confirm that we can reset attributes to their default values after changing them. This is very crucial in situations where we want to "reset" the class instance to its initial configuration.
