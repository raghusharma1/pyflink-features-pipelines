```python
Scenario 1: Testing the initialization of actions_count
Details:
  TestName: test_class_initialization
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the self.actions_count variable is being initialized as None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class under test.
  Act: No action is required in this case.
  Assert: Check if the variable self.actions_count is None.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the initialization of the variables in the constructor is correctly done. This is the base scenario that needs to pass for the further functionalities to work properly.

Scenario 2: Assigning value to actions_count
Details:
  TestName: test_assigning_value_to_actions_count
  Description: This test is intended to change the initial value of actions_count set at initialization and confirm if the change takes effect.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class under test, assign a value (e.g 5) to the actions_count
  Act: No action is required in this case.
  Assert: Check if the newly assigned value has been reflected in self.actions_count
Validation:
  This test validates if a value can be assigned to self.actions_count, and it updates the value of the variable. This is critical as the functionality of the class may be compromised if the values won't be adaptable.

Scenario 3: Assigning different types of data to actions_count
Details:
  TestName: test_assigning_different_datatypes_to_actions_count
  Description: This test is intended to assign different datatypes to actions_count
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class under test, assign different datatypes (integer, string, float, etc) to the actions_count.
  Act: No additional action is required.
  Assert: Check the datatype of self.actions_count after assigning the values.
Validation:
  This test is critical to understand the type of data that can be assigned to self.actions_count, as the datatype of this variable can impact the other functionalities of the class. This test also validates the principle of dynamic typing in python.
