```
Scenario 1: Verifying that map() function initializes the actions_count to zero when it's not set
Details:
  TestName: test_map_initializes_actions_count
  Description: The test is intended to verify that when the 'map' function is invoked, if 'actions_count' is None it is initialized to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance for UserActionIn and Map which is subject to test.
  Act: Invoke the 'map' function with value as UserActionIn instance
  Assert: Check that the map instance value of actions_count is initialized to zero
Validation:
  The test verifies that an uninitialized actions_count is handled and initializes it to zero. This checks that the function sets correct initial state and counter, which is critical for maintaining user's action count.

Scenario 2: Verifying the increment of actions_count and return of UserActionCount object
Details:
  TestName: test_map_increments_actions_count_and_returns_object
  Description: The test is intended to verify that for each call to the 'map' function, 'actions_count' in the state is incremented by one and the returned object is UserActionCount with updated values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple instances for UserActionIn, and map with an assigned initial state (actions_count=0).
  Act: Invoke the map function with the instances of UserActionIn.
  Assert: Check that each returned object of UserActionCount contains incremented 'actions_count' values and assert the values in UserActionCount object to match with the inputs given in UserActionIn.
Validation:
  This test validates if the function correctly increments 'actions_count' for each event and returns an updated UserActionCount object, which is integral to track user actions and provide accurate results. 

Scenario 3: Testing the persistence of state across multiple calls to map function
Details:
  TestName: test_map_persist_state_across_calls
  Description: The test is intended to verify that 'actions_count' maintains its state across multiple invocations of the map function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple instances of UserActionIn and as the map function is stateful, assign an initial state (actions_count=0)
  Act: Invoke the map function with the instances of UserActionIn.
  Assert: For each call, check if the returned UserActionCount object's 'actions_count' attribute has an incremented value based on the prior state.
Validation:
  This test is essential to checking the stateful behaviour of map function, ensuring 'actions_count' is preserved and correctly updated across multiple invocations, maintaining consistency and accuracy in tracking user actions.
