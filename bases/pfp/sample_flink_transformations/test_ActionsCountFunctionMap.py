````
Scenario 1: Validate Map operation with initial state count
Details:
  TestName: test_map_with_initial_state
  Description: This test validates the behavior of the map function when the actions count state is in its initial state, i.e., None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a UserActionIn object with arbitrary values and ensure the initial state of actions_count is None.
  Act: Invoke the map function on the UserActionIn object.
  Assert: The map function should return a UserActionCount object with updated actions_count set to 1.
Validation:
  The test is crucial for validating that the function correctly initializes the action count when it's in the default state and correctly increments it.

Scenario 2: Validate Map operation with subsequent state counts
Details:
  TestName: test_map_with_subsequent_state
  Description: This test validates the map function's correct behavior when the actions_count state has already been incremented previously.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a UserActionIn object with arbitrary values and ensure the actions_count state has a value greater than zero.
  Act: Invoke the map function with the UserActionIn object.
  Assert: The function should return a UserActionCount object with an incrementally increased actions_count value based on the input.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the map function successfully handles the update of counts for subsequent actions.

Scenario 3: Validate Map method's resultant UserActionCount output
Details:
  TestName: test_map_output
  Description: This test is to validate that the map function correctly encapsulates the updated state in a UserActionCount object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a UserActionIn object with necessary values.
  Act: Invoke the map function on the UserActionIn object.
  Assert: Check that the returned UserActionCount object correctly contains the incremented actions_count and maps other attributes from the UserActionIn object.
Validation:
  This test is necessary to validate that the map function appropriately maps input data to the resultant object while updating the actions count.

Scenario 4: Validate Map operation with multiple consecutive actions
Details:
  TestName: test_map_consecutive_actions
  Description: To validate that the map function correctly accumulates the actions count for a single user over multiple consecutive actions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a series of UserActionIn objects for a single user and to represent consecutive actions.
  Act: Invoke the map function on the consecutive UserActionIn objects.
  Assert: Verify that the resultant UserActionCount object's actions_count is equal to the number of UserActionIn objects processed after each map function call.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the map function correctly maintains state over consecutive user actions, a crucial behavior for the business use-case it supports.
