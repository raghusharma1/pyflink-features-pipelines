```
Scenario 1: Validate get_result behavior with positive accumulator
Details:
  TestName: test_get_result_with_positive_value
  Description: This test scenario is intended to verify the behavior of the get_result function when a positive integer value is used as the accumulator.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a value for the accumulator, as a positive integer.
  Act: Invoke the get_result function with the initialized accumulator value.
  Assert: Check if the same integer which was passed in is returned by the get_result function.
Validation:
  Rational: As per the logic of the method, it should return whatever integer value is passed in, verifying it will ascertain the method's functionality is unaffected.

Scenario 2: Validate get_result behavior with zero accumulator
Details:
  TestName: test_get_result_with_zero_value
  Description: This test scenario is intended to verify the behavior of the get_result function when zero is passed as the accumulator value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a value for the accumulator as zero.
  Act: Invoke the get_result function with the initialized accumulator value.
  Assert: Check if zero is returned by the get_result function.
Validation:
  Rational: If the accumulator is zero, the output should also be zero. This test will ensure the function's integrity.

Scenario 3: Validate get_result behavior with negative accumulator
Details:
  TestName: test_get_result_with_negative_value
  Description: This test scenario is intended to verify the behavior of the get_result function when a negative integer value is used as the accumulator.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a value for the accumulator as a negative integer.
  Act: Invoke the get_result function with the accumulator value.
  Assert: Check if the same negative integer which was passed in is returned by the get_result function.
Validation:
  Rational: As per the logic of the method, it should return whatever integer value is passed in, verifying it with a negative number will check the method's functionality with negative values.
  
Scenario 4: Validate get_result behavior with large accumulator value
Details:
  TestName: test_get_result_with_large_value
  Description: This test scenario is intended to verify the behavior of the get_result function when a large integer value is used as the accumulator.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a value for the accumulator as a large integer.
  Act: Invoke the get_result function with the accumulator value.
  Assert: Check if the same large integer which was passed in is returned by the get_result function.
Validation:
  Rational: It's crucial to verify the behavior of the get_result function under various conditions, such as a large integer input, to ensure that the function performs reliably under these scenarios.
