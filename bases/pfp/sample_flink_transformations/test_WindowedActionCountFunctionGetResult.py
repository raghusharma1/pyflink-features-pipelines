Scenario 1: Test to verify if get_result function returns same value as passed through accumulator
Details:
  TestName: test_get_result_same_value_return_as_accumulator
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the get_result() function returns the same value as the accumulator parameter. The get_result() was designed to return the count of actions performed till the point it's being called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and an integer variable to represent the accumulator.
  Act: Invoke the get_result() method on the class instance, passing the accumulator variable.
  Assert: Check that the response from the get_result() matches with the accumulator variable.
Validation:
  Since the get_result method is designed to return the accumulator value, this test is crucial to ascertain that functionality. If this test scenarios fails, it suggests a key business requirement of the get_result method is not being fulfilled.

Scenario 2: Verify that get_result handles different numeric types correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_get_result_with_different_numeric_types
  Description: This test is to verify that get_result() works correctly with both integers and floating-point numbers. Since Python is a dynamically typed language, it's vital that get_result can accurately handle different types of numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and a float variable to represent the accumulator.
  Act: Invoke the get_result() method on the class instance, passing the accumulator variable.
  Assert: Check that the response from the get_result() matches with the accumulator variable.
Validation:
  Since Python is a dynamically typed language, the get_result() method could be used with different number types. Ensuring that it can correctly handle and return a floating point number confirms it is robust and versatile.

Scenario 3: Verifying that get_result handles zero correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_get_result_with_zero_accumulator
  Description: This test is designed to ensure that get_result() correctly handles a situation where the accumulated value is zero, and does not throw any erroneous results or exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class, and a zero integer variable to represent the accumulator.
  Act: Invoke the get_result() method on the class instance, passing the accumulator variable.
  Assert: Check that the response from the get_result() equates to zero.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to ensure that the get_result() method handles zero as input correctly. If this scenario were to fail, it would imply that the get_result() method might not handle zero, which is a legal integer number, as input accurately. It serves as a boundary case in the test cases.
